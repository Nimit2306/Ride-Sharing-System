# Project: Ride-Sharing System

## Project Description
A ride-sharing system where users can request rides, and drivers can offer rides. The system matches users with drivers based on location and availability. The project will include features for user registration, ride requests, ride matching, driver management, and payment processing.

## Features
1. **User Registration and Authentication:**
   - Users (riders and drivers) can create accounts and log in.
   - Authentication ensures secure access to user accounts.

2. **User Profiles:**
   - Riders and drivers can manage their profiles.
   - Profiles include personal information, ratings, and ride history.

3. **Ride Request:**
   - Riders can request rides by providing pickup and drop-off locations.
   - Real-time matching of ride requests with available drivers.

4. **Driver Management:**
   - Drivers can manage their availability and location.
   - Drivers can accept or reject ride requests.

5. **Ride Matching:**
   - The system matches riders with drivers based on proximity and availability.
   - Notifications are sent to both riders and drivers upon successful matching.

6. **Ride Tracking:**
   - Real-time tracking of ride progress.
   - Notification of ride start, ongoing status, and completion.

7. **Payment Processing:**
   - Calculation of ride fares based on distance and time.
   - Integration with payment gateways for processing payments.
   - Generation of ride receipts for users.

8. **Rating and Feedback:**
   - Riders and drivers can rate each other after a ride.
   - Feedback is stored and can be used to improve service quality.

## Technologies
- **Programming Language:** C++
- **Database:** SQL (MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQLite)
- **GUI Framework:** Qt (for desktop application) or a web framework (for web application)

## Database Schema
- **Users Table:** Stores user information (user_id, name, email, password, role [rider/driver], rating, etc.).
- **Rides Table:** Stores ride details (ride_id, rider_id, driver_id, pickup_location, dropoff_location, status, fare, etc.).
- **Drivers Table:** Stores driver-specific information (driver_id, user_id, vehicle_details, availability, location, etc.).
- **Payments Table:** Stores payment details (payment_id, ride_id, amount, payment_method, status, etc.).
- **Feedback Table:** Stores feedback from riders and drivers (feedback_id, ride_id, user_id, rating, comments, etc.).

## Development Steps
1. **Requirement Analysis:**
   - Define detailed requirements and use cases.
   - Identify key functionalities and system components.

2. **System Design:**
   - Design the system architecture, including the database schema.
   - Create wireframes/mockups for the user interface.

3. **Setup Development Environment:**
   - Set up your development environment with necessary tools (C++ compiler, database, Qt, etc.).

4. **Database Development:**
   - Design and implement the database schema.
   - Write SQL scripts for creating tables, indexes, and relationships.

5. **Backend Development:**
   - Implement user authentication and authorization.
   - Develop the ride request and matching logic.
   - Implement driver management and ride tracking features.
   - Integrate payment processing functionality.

6. **Frontend Development:**
   - Develop the user interface using Qt or a web framework.
   - Implement forms and views for user registration, ride requests, and ride tracking.

7. **Testing:**
   - Write unit tests for individual components.
   - Perform integration testing to ensure all components work together.
   - Conduct user acceptance testing to validate the system against requirements.

8. **Deployment:**
   - Deploy the application to a server or distribute the desktop application.
   - Set up a production database and configure the environment.

9. **Documentation:**
   - Write comprehensive documentation for the system, including installation instructions, user guide, and developer guide.

## Additional Considerations
- **Scalability:** Consider how the system can handle increased load (e.g., more users, more ride requests).
- **Security:** Implement secure authentication and data storage practices.
- **User Experience:** Focus on creating an intuitive and responsive user interface.
- **Future Enhancements:** Plan for potential future features like ride-sharing (multiple riders), advanced fare calculations, and AI-based ride matching.

## Implementation Tips
- **Modular Design:** Keep the code modular to make it easier to manage and extend.
- **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling to improve system reliability.
- **Version Control:** Use a version control system (e.g., Git) to manage code changes and collaborate with others.
